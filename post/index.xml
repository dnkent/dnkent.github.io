      <title>Predicting the Onset of Civil War</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can machine learning techniques be used to predict the onset of civil wars? We find that tree-based models
for machine learning, particularly gradient boosting machines, outperform canonical generalized linear models
from the political science literature as predictors of intrastate violence. Moreover, we find support for a novel
preditor of armed conflict &amp;ndash; the international arms trade network.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Randomization Approach to Dynamic Analysis of Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://dnkent.github.io/post/dynamic_effects/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across the social sciences scholars regularly pool effects over substantial periods of time,
a practice that produces faulty inferences if the underlying data generating process is dy-
namic. To help researchers better perform principled analyses of time-varying processes,
we develop a two-stage procedure based upon statistical randomization techniques. Given
panel data, we break the role of time through randomization and produce null distributions
that reflect a time-invariant data generating process. These null distributions serve as a ref-
erence point for the observed trends over time, enabling the quantification of time-varying
effects and the detection of where changes in effects occur. Through a Monte Carlo simu-
lation study, we find that our randomization technique outperforms cutting-edge software
for Bayesian changepoint analysis. A particular benefit of our method is that, by estab-
lishing the bounds for time-invariant effects before interacting with actual estimates over
time, it is able to differentiate gradual changes from effects with a stable mean but high
variance. We also demonstrate the method’s utility by applying it to a popular study on the
relationship between alliance types and the initiation of militarized interstate disputes. The
example illustrates how the technique can help researchers make inferences about where
changes occur in dynamic relationships and ask important theoretical questions about the
causes and consequences of such changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Public Fears of Terrorism, Partisan Rhetoric, and the Foundations of American Interventionism</title>
      <link>https://dnkent.github.io/post/fear_terrorism/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An American’s yearly chance of being killed by a terrorist attack sits at about 1 in 3.5 million.
Yet over 40% of the public have been consistently found to believe they or a family member
are likely or very likely to be the victim of a terror attack. Can these heightened estimates of
the risks posed by terrorism be brought closer to reality? With trillions of dollars spent on the
War on Terror, this question is not just theoretically but practically important. To investigate,
we use an experimental approach, testing whether participants update beliefs when presented
with factual information about the risks posed by terrorism. Across survey experiments fielded on
NORC&amp;rsquo;s AmeriSpeak and Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Mechanical Turk platform we find that the overblown fear of terrorism
is indeed reducible. Moreover, treatment effects last over time, maintaining significance when participants
were recontacted two-weeks after the initial survey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keeping Your Friends Close, But Acquaintances Closer: Why Weakly Allied States Make Committed Coalition Partners</title>
      <link>https://dnkent.github.io/post/isaf/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 14:46:01 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do states join wartime coalitions despite the absence of a salient threat or strong
ties to the coalition leader? We argue states make unexpectedly high contributions to coalition warfare
as a costly signal of their desire for a stronger relationship with the coalition
leader. Conventional theories insufficiently explain why states without immediate security
interests or strong ties to the lead state over-contribute relative to their capacity. Using
newly compiled data on troop contributions to the war in Afghanistan (2001-2014), we
find states are most likely to contribute a higher share of their armed forces when their
relationship with the US has unrealized alliance potential. States with under-performing
alignments leave substantial room for subsequent gains to be had from signaling their commitment to the leading coalition actor.
Our finding helps explain why states risk the costs
of war – casualties and domestic accountability – by participating in coalition warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
