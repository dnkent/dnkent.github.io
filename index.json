To help researchers better perform principled analyses of time-varying processes, we develop a two-stage procedure based upon statistical randomization techniques. Given panel data, we break the role of time through randomization and produce null distributions that reflect a time-invariant data generating process. These null distributions serve as a ref- erence point for the observed trends over time, enabling the quantification of time-varying effects and the detection of where changes in effects occur. Through a Monte Carlo simu- lation study, we find that our randomization technique outperforms cutting-edge software for Bayesian changepoint analysis. A particular benefit of our method is that, by estab- lishing the bounds for time-invariant effects before interacting with actual estimates over time, it is able to differentiate gradual changes from effects with a stable mean but high variance. We also demonstrate the method’s utility by applying it to a popular study on the relationship between alliance types and the initiation of militarized interstate disputes. The example illustrates how the technique can help researchers make inferences about where changes occur in dynamic relationships and ask important theoretical questions about the causes and consequences of such changes.\n","date":1565032501,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565032501,"objectID":"9256f7499f1ab2a664833ba17f0a9064","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/post/dynamic_effects/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T15:15:01-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/dynamic_effects/","section":"post","summary":"Under review, paper available upon request","tags":[],"title":"A Randomization Approach to Dynamic Analysis of Panel Data","type":"post"},{"authors":["With Daniel Silverman (Carnegie Mellon University) and Christopher Gelpi"],"categories":[],"content":"An American’s yearly chance of being killed by a terrorist attack sits at about 1 in 3.5 million. Yet over 40% of the public have been consistently found to believe they or a family member are likely or very likely to be the victim of a terror attack. Can these heightened estimates of the risks posed by terrorism be brought closer to reality? With trillions of dollars spent on the War on Terror, this question is not just theoretically but practically important. To investigate, we use an experimental approach, testing whether participants update beliefs when presented with factual information about the risks posed by terrorism. Across survey experiments fielded on NORC\u0026rsquo;s AmeriSpeak and Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Mechanical Turk platform we find that the overblown fear of terrorism is indeed reducible. Moreover, treatment effects last over time, maintaining significance when participants were recontacted two-weeks after the initial survey.\n","date":1565031117,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565031117,"objectID":"87792f564f2ea54508335476b3b91427","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/post/fear_terrorism/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T14:51:57-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/fear_terrorism/","section":"post","summary":"In preparation","tags":[],"title":"Public Fears of Terrorism, Partisan Rhetoric, and the Foundations of American Interventionism","type":"post"},{"authors":["With J.

We argue states make unexpectedly high contributions to coalition warfare as a costly signal of their desire for a stronger relationship with the coalition leader. Conventional theories insufficiently explain why states without immediate security interests or strong ties to the lead state over-contribute relative to their capacity. Using newly compiled data on troop contributions to the war in Afghanistan (2001-2014), we find states are most likely to contribute a higher share of their armed forces when their relationship with the US has unrealized alliance potential. States with under-performing alignments leave substantial room for subsequent gains to be had from signaling their commitment to the leading coalition actor. Our finding helps explain why states risk the costs of war – casualties and domestic accountability – by participating in coalition warfare.\n","date":1565030761,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565030761,"objectID":"c869f4098bba5858093a02e5d52ffa77","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/post/isaf/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T14:46:01-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/isaf/","section":"post","summary":"Under review, paper available upon request","tags":[],"title":"Keeping Your Friends Close, But Acquaintances Closer: Why Weakly Allied States Make Committed Coalition Partners","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1565029597,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565029597,"objectID":"9bbf79d01bf1d9767793340208384d3c","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/project/isaf/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T14:26:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/isaf/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Keeping Your Friends Close, But Acquaintances Closer: Why Weakly Allied States Make Committed Coalition Partners","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Many thanks to Drew Rosenberg for designing this course. Any deficiencies are certainly due to my own tinkering.\nThe course syllabus is available here.\nCourse Description: The purpose of this workshop is to provide incoming first year Ph.D. students with some fundamental skills in various mathematical techniques that are used in political science, regardless of sub-specialty, and generally to prepare students for the first-year methods sequence. The workshop is also open to continuing students who feel that they would gain from participating in the course. This year the course will begin on Monday August 5th and run every weekday until Friday August 16th. Class sessions are tentatively scheduled to run from 09:00-12:30 with approximately a 20-30 minute break in between two 1.5 hour sessions. In addition, an optional introductory sequence to R computing is provided.\nThis workshop has a \u0026ldquo;semi-flipped\u0026rdquo; format, which means that I expect you to watch videos and do some reading ahead of each class. Each day I lecture on topics and sub-topics that I think need extra attention. Group work and other activities follow the lectures.\nBelow is the schedule and the appropriate videos to watch before each session. These videos are meant to supplement textbook reading, and spur class discussion. All of the videos are freely available from Khan Academy and YouTube. These videos are a minimum for each topic; however, going through additional ones, particularly for advanced topics, is suggested. Also, keep in mind that videos get taken down all the time for various reasons. If one is not available, then please let me know and do your best to find a replacement.\nDay 1: Intro, Notation and Definitions, and Some Basic Mathematics  Read this essay by Carol Dweck, \u0026ldquo;Even Geniuses Work Hard.\u0026rdquo;\n Read this short essay.
