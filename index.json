The first chapter develops a dataset with estimates for every country\u0026rsquo;s level of dissatisfaction with the international system from 1816-2012. The second chapter takes these dissatisfaction measures and uses them as features in a machine learning model which predicts international conflict onset. The third chapter explores spillover effects in social networks, demonstrating how causal forests can be employed to uncover spillover effect heterogeneity. Across these chapters, machine learning techniques are instrumental in modeling outcomes of interest and leveraging information from social networks.\nIn the first chapter, I propose a novel measure of international dissatisfaction spanning from 1816 to 2012 which explicitly operationalizes Gilpin\u0026rsquo;s framework: the difference between a state\u0026rsquo;s expected and actual benefits from the international status quo. I estimate a state\u0026rsquo;s expected international benefits by building upon recent efforts to train machine learning ensembles on war outcomes, which I then use to weight a state\u0026rsquo;s observable material capabilities. I estimate actual international benefits by averaging across a state\u0026rsquo;s centrality in valued international networks. The measure provides multiple advantages over alternative estimates both conceptually and statistically. Beyond its conceptual value, the measure\u0026rsquo;s association with militarized conflict is robust to model specifications, unlike the current go-to measure when modeling country-level sentiments: ideal point estimates from United Nations voting records.\nThe second chapter asks: when do revisionist states occur? Most responses to this question fall under one of three categories: 1) differential growth rates, 2) domestic political changes, or 3) international dissatisfaction. While these arguments are all based on rich research traditions, it is an open question as to which theory best predicts when revision occurs. In order to provide such an empirical comparison, I build a series of machine learning ensembles that predict interstate conflict onset and vary only in the included features. While the models for each of the three theories unsurprisingly demonstrate meaningful predictive capacity, the ensemble based on measures of international dissatisfaction is more accurate than counterparts based on differential growth rates and domestic political changes. The paper\u0026rsquo;s results do not invalidate theories of rising powers and revolutionary regimes, but they do emphasize a greater focus on a state\u0026rsquo;s standing within the broader international system.\nThe final chapter develops a procedure for estimating heterogeneous spillover effects. In social environments, interference between units is likely the norm, not the exception. This poses a problem for estimating causal effects, where the potential outcomes framework assumes that one unit\u0026rsquo;s treatment assignment has no effect on another unit\u0026rsquo;s outcome. In response to this concern, one increasingly popular approach for handling interference between units is the estimation of spillover effects, where sharing a networked tie to a treated unit confers indirect treatment exposure. However, like average treatment effects, there are good reasons to expect that spillovers vary in magnitude and direction across contexts. In order to capture this variation, I approach spillovers through the lens of heterogeneous treatment effects, which can be modeled with causal random forests\n","date":1584307237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584307237,"objectID":"3e0c49bc43d8a232eee46e4f62b996b1","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/post/measuring-international-dissatisfaction/","publishdate":"2020-03-15T17:20:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/measuring-international-dissatisfaction/","section":"post","summary":"Chapter 1: Measuring International Dissatisfaction\n  Chapter 2: Predicting International Conflict and Revision\n  Chapter 3: Estimating Heterogeneous Spillover Effects\n  This dissertation leverages developments in machine learning methods to better model networked social processes, with an emphasis on international politics.

To help researchers better perform principled analyses of time-varying processes, we develop a two-stage procedure based upon techniques for permutation testing and statistical process monitoring. Given time series cross-sectional data, we break the role of time through permutation inference and produce a null distribution that reflects a time-invariant data generating process. The null distribution then serves as a stable reference point, enabling the detection of effect changepoints. In Monte Carlo simulations our randomization technique outperforms alternatives for changepoint analysis. A particular benefit of our method is that, by establishing the bounds for time-invariant effects before interacting with actual estimates, it is able to differentiate stochastic fluctuations from genuine changes. We demonstrate the method\u0026rsquo;s utility by applying it to a popular study on the relationship between alliances and the initiation of militarized interstate disputes. The example illustrates how the technique can help researchers make inferences about where changes occur in dynamic relationships and ask important questions about such changes.\n","date":1584126901,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584126901,"objectID":"9256f7499f1ab2a664833ba17f0a9064","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/post/dynamic_effects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dynamic_effects/","section":"post","summary":"Conditionally Accepted at *Political Analysis*","tags":[],"title":"A Permutation-Based Changepoint Technique for Monitoring Effect Sizes","type":"post"},{"authors":["With Daniel Silverman (Carnegie Mellon University) and Christopher Gelpi"],"categories":[],"content":"Download the paper here.\nAn American’s yearly chance of being killed by a terrorist attack sits at roughly 1 in 3.5 million. Yet, over 40% of the American public consistently believes that they or their family members are likely to be the victim of a terror attack. Can these inflated estimates of the risks of terrorism be brought closer to reality? With trillions of dollars spent on the “War on Terror,” this question is not just theoretically but practically important. In order to investigate, we use an experimental approach assessing whether people update their core beliefs about the terror threat when given factual information about the risks it actually presents. We find that public fear of terrorism and demand for countering it can be sharply reduced with better information, dropping essentially to pre-9/11 levels after receiving the treatments and staying that way two weeks later. These results show that the American public’s exaggerated fear of terrorism – which has facilitated many of the country’s costly foreign policy decisions since 9/11 – is far more malleable and correctible than previously thought. In this sense, countering terrorism may largely require providing more context and perspective.\n","date":1584039117,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584039117,"objectID":"87792f564f2ea54508335476b3b91427","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/post/fear_terrorism/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/fear_terrorism/","section":"post","summary":"Under Review","tags":[],"title":"Putting Terror in its Place: An Experiment on Mitigating Fears of Terrorism Among the American Public","type":"post"},{"authors":["With James Wilson (University of San Francisco) and Skyler Cranmer"],"categories":[],"content":"Can machine learning techniques be used to predict the onset of civil wars?

We argue states make unexpectedly high contributions to coalition warfare as a costly signal of their desire for a stronger relationship with the coalition leader. Conventional theories insufficiently explain why states without immediate security interests or strong ties to the lead state over-contribute relative to their capacity. Using newly compiled data on troop contributions to the war in Afghanistan (2001-2014), we find states are most likely to contribute a higher share of their armed forces when their relationship with the US has unrealized alliance potential. States with under-performing alignments leave substantial room for subsequent gains to be had from signaling their commitment to the leading coalition actor. Our finding helps explain why states risk the costs of war – casualties and domestic accountability – by participating in coalition warfare.\n","date":1565030761,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565030761,"objectID":"c869f4098bba5858093a02e5d52ffa77","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/post/isaf/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T14:46:01-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/isaf/","section":"post","summary":"Invited to Revise and Resubmit at *Journal of Conflict Resolution*","tags":[],"title":"Keeping Your Friends Close, But Acquaintances Closer: Why Weakly Allied States Make Committed Coalition Partners","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1565029597,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565029597,"objectID":"9bbf79d01bf1d9767793340208384d3c","permalink":"https://dnkent.github.io/project/isaf/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T14:26:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/isaf/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Keeping Your Friends Close, But Acquaintances Closer: Why Weakly Allied States Make Committed Coalition Partners","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Many thanks to Drew Rosenberg for designing this course. Any deficiencies are certainly due to my own tinkering.\n The course syllabus is available here.\nThe course lectures notes are available here.\nCourse Description: The purpose of this workshop is to provide incoming first year Ph.D. students with some fundamental skills in various mathematical techniques that are used in political science, regardless of sub-specialty, and generally to prepare students for the first-year methods sequence. The workshop is also open to continuing students who feel that they would gain from participating in the course. This year the course will begin on Monday August 5th and run every weekday until Friday August 16th. Class sessions are tentatively scheduled to run from 09:00-12:30 with approximately a 20-30 minute break in between two 1.5 hour sessions. In addition, an optional introductory sequence to R computing is provided.\nThis workshop has a \u0026ldquo;semi-flipped\u0026rdquo; format, which means that I expect you to watch videos and do some reading ahead of each class. Each day I lecture on topics and sub-topics that I think need extra attention. Group work and other activities follow the lectures.\nBelow is the schedule and the appropriate videos to watch before each session. These videos are meant to supplement textbook reading, and spur class discussion. All of the videos are freely available from Khan Academy and YouTube. These videos are a minimum for each topic; however, going through additional ones, particularly for advanced topics, is suggested. Also, keep in mind that videos get taken down all the time for various reasons. If one is not available, then please let me know and do your best to find a replacement.\nDay 1: Intro, Notation and Definitions, and Some Basic Mathematics   Read thisessay by Carol Dweck, \u0026ldquo;Even Geniuses Work Hard.\u0026rdquo;\n  Read thisshort essay.
